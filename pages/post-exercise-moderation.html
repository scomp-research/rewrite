<h3>Debrief:</h3>

Thank you for participating in our study. While we told you in the task description very generally that we were studying commenting behavior and moderation, we are also studying how design of Web Pages influences how people write comments.  More specifically, we are investigating whether inclusion in the process of moderation affects how people act and perceive others in online comment forums.
<br>
<br>
All participants were shown the same brief passage from the article, and all users were shown the same set of comments; these comments were not generated by other participants but rather by the research team. This was done to ensure that participants each had the same starting point. Before entering a comment, you and other participants were assigned to one of three conditions:
<br>
<br>
1) Write a surprise twist ending for an offensive post
<br>
2) Remove half of the words from an offensive post
<br>
3) No task - participants allowed to comment right away
<br>
<br>
With this information, we hope to better design webpages to effectively curate, display, or respond to comments to facilitate useful and productive discussion. We believe that, if successful, this research will contribute to better-designed interfaces for text chats and comment threads. 
<br>
<br>
If you have any questions about this study, or wish to withdraw from the study, please contact the principal investigator, Kevin Seelaus, at kseelaus@andrew.cmu.edu.
<br>
<br>
Finally, we request that you not discuss this study with anyone else who is currently participating or might participate at a future point in time. We will not be able to examine rigorously the effect of these design elements on participants who know beforehand the full purpose of this study.
<br>
<br>
Thank you!
